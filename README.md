# Defence-against-Malware-Attacks-on-DNN
Defence against malware attacks on deep neural networks (DNN) is critical to prevent cyber threats. Techniques such as anomaly detection and adversarial training can be used to improve the security of DNNs against malware attacks. This project demonstrates the potential of leveraging advanced techniques to enhance the security of DNNs and protect against cyber threats.
