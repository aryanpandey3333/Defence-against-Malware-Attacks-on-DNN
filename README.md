# Defence-against-Malware-Attacks-on-DNN
In order to prevent cyber threats, it is essential to have strong defence mechanisms against malware attacks on deep neural networks (DNNs). By utilizing advanced techniques such as anomaly detection and adversarial training, DNNs can be fortified against such attacks. This project showcases the potential of these techniques in enhancing the security of DNNs and safeguarding against cyber threats.
